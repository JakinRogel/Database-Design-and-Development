This album doesn\'t seem quite ready for release, evidenced by the short, one-year gap between Mansion and Therapy Session. Regardless, NF has blown past the sophomore slump, creating a project well-worth listening to.\"[6] Awarding the album four and a half stars at Jesus Freak Hideout, Kevin Hoskins writes, \"Many are not going to like the pure raw emotions here, but I am a fan of someone who can offer something outside of the box and this fits that bill perfectly.\"[7] Mark Rice, rating the album three and a half stars for Jesus Freak Hideout, states, \"Personally, I\'m ambivalent towards NF\'s approach, but it makes for a good, thoughtful, and memorable listen.

This has \'album of the year\' written all over it.\"[4] Steve Hayes, delivering a ten out of ten review at Cross Rhythms, regards this as, \"unquestionably one of the finest ever to emerge from the gospel hip-hop scene.\"[3]'),
